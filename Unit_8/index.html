		JUST A MATCH?

		<p>
		Why is it called a match? - Where stood the tree of which is was made? - Who made it? - Is it true that only a century ago little girls would roam city streets to sell matches to Gentlemen?

		In a series of 70 numbered tweets sent over several hours, user @JustKhuthi told the story of the disappearance and eventual death of her childhood friend Kamo Peterson, a young actuarial science graduate heading for a career in professional tennis. </p>

		The Story of a watch that you couldn't buy
		</h3>
		<p>
		For many years, it was near to impossible to purchase a new stainless Rolex Daytona, even if everybody wanted one. 
		What makes things worse is that Rolex had not published a single advertisement for the stainless steel Rolex Daytona for  many decades.</p> 
		<div class="picture-3">
		 	<img src="pictures/RolexDaytona.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>How could it be possible that a watch that is never advertised could have an infinite waiting list?
		Fast forward to today, and a vintage Rolex Daytona model originally for sale at $210 is now worth between $15,000 and $250,000.

		<h3>
		How a pair of pants became The Levi's	
		</h3>
		<p>
		Around 1872, Levi received a letter from one of his customers, Jacob Davis, a Reno, Nevada tailor. In his letter, Davis disclosed the unique way he made pants for his customers, through the use of rivets at points of strain to make them last longer.</p> 
		<div class="picture-4">
			<img src="pictures/LevisJeans.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>Davis wanted to patent this new idea, but needed a business partner to get the idea off the ground. Levi was enthusiastic about the idea. The patent was granted to Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss & Company on May 20, 1873; and blue jeans were born.
