				<h3>Girls from South Africa gets worldwide attention - with one story:</h3>
				<p>In a series of 70 numbered tweets sent over several hours, user @JustKhuthi told the story of the disappearance and eventual death of her childhood friend Kamo Peterson, a young actuarial science graduate heading for a career in professional tennis. Only that it wasn't true.
				The hint that the story was fiction not fact was in this tweet, not numbered and sent before all the rest. It says: "Story time ... "

				<h3>The Story of a watch that you couldn't buy</h3>
				<p>
				For many years, it was near to impossible to purchase a new stainless Rolex Daytona, even if everybody wanted one. 
				What makes things worse is that Rolex had not published a single advertisement for the stainless steel Rolex Daytona for  many decades. How could it be possible that a watch that is never advertised could have an infinite waiting list?
				Fast forward to today, and a vintage Rolex Daytona model originally for sale at $210 is now worth between $15,000 and $250,000.

				<h3>How a pair of pants became The Levi's</h3>
				<p>Around 1872, Levi received a letter from one of his customers, Jacob Davis, a Reno, Nevada tailor. In his letter, Davis disclosed the unique way he made pants for his customers, through the use of rivets at points of strain to make them last longer. Davis wanted to patent this new idea, but needed a business partner to get the idea off the ground. Levi was enthusiastic about the idea. The patent was granted to Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss & Company on May 20, 1873; and blue jeans were born.</p>
